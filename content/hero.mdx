# hey, i'm sriraam

Founding Engineer at [Decode](https://decode.dev/), building a browser and whiteboard for Claude Code.

Currently studying Reinforcement Learning by building an open source [SWE-Grep](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-grep) model under [Prof Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/).

I also build RL environments through [Prime Intellect](https://www.primeintellect.ai/)'s bounty program.

Previously studied Learning Design at [Harvard](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/) which has led me to see many UX problems as learning problems.

I love Hogwarts, Anime, and K-dramas.
