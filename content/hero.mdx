# hey, i'm sriraam

Founding Engineer at <IconLink href="https://decode.dev/" icon="/decode.png">Decode</IconLink>, building a browser and whiteboard for Claude Code.

Currently studying Reinforcement Learning by building an open-source [SWE-Grep](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-grep) model under [Prof Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/).

I also build open-source RL environments through <IconLink href="https://www.primeintellect.ai/" icon="/prime.jpeg">Prime Intellect</IconLink>'s bounty program.

Previously studied Learning Design at <IconLink href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/" icon="/harvard.png" imageClassName="rounded-none" imageWidth={13.5} imageHeight={13.5}>Harvard</IconLink> which has led me to see many UX problems as learning problems.

I love Hogwarts, Anime, and K-dramas.
