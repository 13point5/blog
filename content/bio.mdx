Founding Engineer at <Link href="https://decode.dev/" variant="underline" icon="/decode.png">Decode</Link>, building a browser and whiteboard for Claude Code.

Currently building an open-source [SWE-Grep](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-grep) model using RL with [Prof Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/) and a team at CMU.

I also build open-source RL environments through <Link href="https://www.primeintellect.ai/" variant="underline" icon="/prime.jpeg">Prime Intellect</Link>'s bounty program cuz they're cool.

Previously studied Learning Design at <Link href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/" variant="underline" icon="/harvard.png" iconClassName="rounded-none" iconSize={13.5}>Harvard</Link> which has led me to see many UX problems as learning problems.

I like Hogwarts, Anime, and K-dramas.
