Learn how to build a production-ready RAG system from the ground up.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval to produce more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## Getting Started

First, let's set up our environment and dependencies...
